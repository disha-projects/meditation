# Fix Netlify MIME Type Error

## Completed
- [x] Updated vite.config.js to set base: './' for relative paths

## Next Steps
- [ ] Build the project: Run `npm run build` to generate production files
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify: Upload the `dist` folder to Netlify
- [ ] Test deployment: Verify the app loads without MIME type errors

## Notes
- The base: './' setting makes all asset paths relative, which should resolve the MIME type issue on Netlify
- After building, the `dist` folder will contain the production-ready files
